## Introduction
The Matlab scripts contained in this repository were used to pre-process and analyze the EEG data acquired as part of an ERP study aimed to validate the Efforts Model of Simultaneous Interpreting (Gile, XXXX).The results of the study are presented in a paper that is currently in submission (review).

## Data
The raw and pre-processed EEG and ERP data for all the participants can be found [here](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/ArTX/x4R4CfqpP). For more information about the dataset structure refer to our paper (Koshkin, Ossadtchi, Shtyrov 2017). 

## Dependencies
